# Mini-Shell
The shell supports program execution and I/O redirection.  The main structure of the shell is simple. The main loop reads the input on the command line. Then it calls fork, which creates a copy of the shell process. The parent shell calls wait, while the child process runs the command. For example, if the command is echo hello, the child will execute instrcutions from echo. At some point, echo will call exit which will cause the parent to return from wait in main.   The shell is the parent process. It reads each line of input from the command line, forks a child shell process, which in turn exec's the command. The shell parent process waits for the child to complete and then prompts for the next command.
